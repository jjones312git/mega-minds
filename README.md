# MegaMinds - AI Development Team Framework

A multi-agent workflow system that orchestrates specialized AI agents to work together as a cohesive development team. MegaMinds transforms Claude Code into a collaborative AI development environment where different agents handle specific aspects of software development - from planning and architecture to implementation and deployment.

## Overview

MegaMinds creates an intelligent development ecosystem where:
- **Specialized AI agents** work on their areas of expertise (frontend, backend, database, testing, etc.)
- **Smart coordination** ensures agents collaborate effectively and hand off work seamlessly
- **Quality gates** enforce high standards before any code progresses
- **Memory management** maintains context across long development sessions
- **Decision councils** bring together expert agents for critical technical choices

## Key Features

### ü§ñ 40+ Specialized Agents
- **Planning & Strategy**: Project orchestration, requirements analysis, risk assessment
- **Design & Architecture**: UX/UI design, database schemas, API design, security architecture
- **Development**: Frontend, backend, database, authentication implementations
- **Quality Assurance**: Testing, code review, performance analysis, security auditing
- **DevOps**: CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure, monitoring, backup/recovery
- **Business Operations**: Analytics, customer support, marketing automation
- **SaaS Features**: Multi-tenancy, subscription management, onboarding flows

### üß† Intelligent Memory System

- Problem-solving swarms for critical issues
- Clear escalation paths for blockers

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 14.0 or higher
- npm or yarn package manager
- Claude Code (for AI agent execution)

### Global Installation (Recommended)

```bash
npm install -g mega-minds
```

Or with yarn:

```bash
yarn global add mega-minds
```

### Local Installation

```bash
npm install mega-minds
```

## Getting Started

### 1. Initialize MegaMinds in Your Project

Navigate to your project directory and run:

```bash
mega-minds init
```

This will:
- Create a `.mega-minds/` directory for memory and state management
- Generate a `CLAUDE.md` file that Claude Code will automatically read
- Set up agent templates and workflow configurations
- Initialize the memory management system

### 2. Start Claude Code

Open Claude Code in your project directory. It will automatically read the `CLAUDE.md` file and have access to all MegaMinds capabilities.

### 3. Begin Development

Start with a high-level request to Claude Code:

```
"I want to build a task management SaaS application with user authentication, 
team collaboration, real-time updates, and subscription billing."
```

The AI development team will:
1. Analyze your requirements
2. Create a technical architecture
3. Design the user interface
4. Implement features systematically
5. Test everything thoroughly
6. Set up deployment infrastructure

## Available Commands

### Project Management
- `mega-minds init` - Initialize MegaMinds in your project
- `mega-minds agent-status` - View current agent activities
- `mega-minds save-session "description"` - Save current development state
- `mega-minds load-session` - Restore previous session
- `mega-minds compress-context` - Optimize memory when approaching limits

### Memory Management
- `mega-minds update-memory "what happened"` - Update project documentation
- `mega-minds clear-memory` - Reset memory (use with caution)

## How It Works

### Agent Coordination Flow

1. **Request Analysis**: Your request is analyzed to determine which agents are needed
2. **Planning Phase**: The project orchestrator creates an execution plan
3. **Parallel Execution**: Multiple agents work simultaneously on independent tasks
4. **Quality Gates**: All work passes through review before progressing
5. **Integration**: Components are integrated with proper testing
6. **Deployment**: Final deployment with monitoring and backup systems

### Memory Management

MegaMinds maintains intelligent memory across sessions:
- **Architecture Documentation**: Technical decisions and system design
- **Recent Work Log**: What was accomplished in recent sessions
- **Active Context**: Current focus areas and pending tasks
- **Agent State**: Which agents are working on what

### Quality Enforcement

Every piece of work must pass quality checks:
- Code review by specialized review agents
- Automated testing at unit, integration, and e2e levels
- Security scanning for vulnerabilities
- Performance testing for scalability

## Example Workflows

### Building a New Feature
```
User: "Add a commenting system to the blog posts"
```
MegaMinds will coordinate:
- Requirements analysis for comment features
- Database schema design for comments
- API endpoint creation
- Frontend UI implementation
- Real-time update system
- Moderation capabilities
- Testing and deployment

### Technical Decision Making
```
User: "Should we use PostgreSQL or MongoDB for our application?"
```
MegaMinds will convene a decision council with:
- Database architecture agent
- Performance testing agent
- Infrastructure agent
- Security architecture agent

### Emergency Response
```
User: "The application is running slowly in production"
```
MegaMinds activates a problem-solving swarm:
- Monitoring agent checks metrics
- Database agent analyzes queries
- Performance agent identifies bottlenecks
- Infrastructure agent reviews resources

## Project Structure

After initialization, your project will have:

```
your-project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .mega-minds/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ memory/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ architecture.md      # System design documentation
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ recent-work.md       # Recent development log
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ sessions/            # Saved session states
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ agents/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ active-context.md    # Current agent activities
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ logs/
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ handoffs.log         # Agent coordination log
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CLAUDE.md                     # Main interface for Claude Code
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [your project files]
```

## Best Practices

1. **Start with Clear Requirements**: The more specific your initial request, the better the results
2. **Trust the Process**: Let agents hand off work naturally rather than micromanaging
3. **Save Sessions Regularly**: Use `mega-minds save-session` before major changes
4. **Monitor Token Usage**: Use `compress-context` when Claude Code mentions token limits
5. **Review Agent Decisions**: Check the decision logs to understand technical choices

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Token limit approaching"**
- Run `mega-minds compress-context` to optimize memory
- Save current session and start fresh if needed

**"Agent handoff failed"**
- Check `.mega-minds/logs/handoffs.log` for details
- Ensure all quality gates are passing
- Restart the specific agent task

**"Memory not persisting"**
- Verify `.mega-minds/` directory exists
- Check file permissions
- Run `mega-minds init` again if needed
