## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 14.0 or higher
- npm or yarn package manager
- Claude Code (for AI agent execution)

### Installation Methods

#### Method 1: Global Installation (Recommended)

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g mega-minds

# Install to project
npm install mega-minds

# Navigate to your project
cd your-project

# Initialize mega-minds
mega-minds init
```

This will:
1. Create `.claude/` directory with agents and workflows
2. Add mega-minds to your package.json dependencies
3. Install the dependency automatically

#### Method 2: Project-Specific Installation

```bash
# Install as project dependency
cd your-project
npm install mega-minds --save

# Initialize the agents
npx mega-minds init
```

### How It Works

MegaMinds operates in two parts:

1. **Agent Templates** (`.claude/` directory):
   - Sub-agent markdown files for Claude Code
   - Workflow definitions and protocols
   - Main configuration file (claude.md)

2. **Core Functionality** (`node_modules/mega-minds/`):
   - SessionManager for development sessions
   - TokenManager for context optimization
   - MemoryManager for project memory
   - AgentStateTracker for coordination
   - CLI tools for management

## Getting Started

### 1. Initialize MegaMinds in Your Project

Navigate to your project directory and run:

```bash
mega-minds init
```

This will:
- Create a `.claude/` directory with all agent templates
- Generate a `claude.md` file that Claude Code will automatically read
- Add mega-minds to your package.json as a dependency
- Set up workflow configurations and protocols
- Initialize the memory management system

**Post-Installation Structure:**
```
your-project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .claude/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ agents/          # Claude Code sub-agents
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ workflows/       # Communication protocols
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ claude.md        # Main configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ node_modules/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ mega-minds/      # Core AI team functionality
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json         # Updated with mega-minds dependency
```

### 2. Start Claude Code

Open Claude Code in your project directory. It will automatically read the `.claude/claude.md` file and have access to all MegaMinds capabilities.

**Important:** The mega-minds package must remain installed as a dependency for the memory management and coordination features to work properly.

### 3. Enable Automated Hooks (Optional but Recommended)

**üö® IMPORTANT FOR NON-TECHNICAL USERS:**

The hooks setup command must be run in your **computer's regular terminal**, NOT in Claude Code:

#### For Mac Users:
1. Press `Cmd + Space` 
2. Type "Terminal" and press Enter
3. Navigate to your project: `cd path/to/your/project`
4. Run: `npx mega-minds setup-hooks`

#### For Windows Users:
1. Press `Win + R`
2. Type "cmd" and press Enter  
3. Navigate to your project: `cd path\to\your\project`
4. Run: `npx mega-minds setup-hooks`

#### What This Enables:
- **Auto Quality Gates**: Tests and code review run automatically after code changes
- **Smart Session Saves**: Your work is automatically saved when agents finish tasks
- **Context Protection**: Preserves important workflow state during memory cleanup
- **Development Notifications**: Desktop alerts for key milestones

**Once setup is complete, everything else works automatically in Claude Code!**

### 4. Begin Development

Start with a high-level request to Claude Code:

```
"I want to build a task management SaaS application with user authentication, 
team collaboration, real-time updates, and subscription billing."
```

The AI development team will:
1. Analyze your requirements
2. Create a technical architecture
3. Design the user interface
4. Implement features systematically
5. Test everything thoroughly
6. Set up deployment infrastructure

With hooks enabled, quality gates and session saves happen automatically!

## How It Works

### Agent Coordination Flow

1. **Request Analysis**: Your request is analyzed to determine which agents are needed
2. **Planning Phase**: The project orchestrator creates an execution plan
3. **Parallel Execution**: Multiple agents work simultaneously on independent tasks
4. **Quality Gates**: All work passes through review before progressing
5. **Integration**: Components are integrated with proper testing
6. **Deployment**: Final deployment with monitoring and backup systems

### Memory Management

MegaMinds maintains intelligent memory across sessions:
- **Architecture Documentation**: Technical decisions and system design
- **Recent Work Log**: What was accomplished in recent sessions
- **Active Context**: Current focus areas and pending tasks
- **Agent State**: Which agents are working on what

### Quality Enforcement

Every piece of work must pass quality checks:
- Code review by specialized review agents
- Automated testing at unit, integration, and e2e levels
- Security scanning for vulnerabilities
- Performance testing for scalability

## Example Workflows

### Building a New Feature
```
User: "Add a commenting system to the blog posts"
```
MegaMinds will coordinate:
- Requirements analysis for comment features
- Database schema design for comments
- API endpoint creation
- Frontend UI implementation
- Real-time update system
- Moderation capabilities
- Testing and deployment

### Technical Decision Making
```
User: "Should we use PostgreSQL or MongoDB for our application?"
```
MegaMinds will convene a decision council with:
- Database architecture agent
- Performance testing agent
- Infrastructure agent
- Security architecture agent

### Emergency Response
```
User: "The application is running slowly in production"
```
MegaMinds activates a problem-solving swarm:
- Monitoring agent checks metrics
- Database agent analyzes queries
- Performance agent identifies bottlenecks
- Infrastructure agent reviews resources

## Project Structure

After initialization, your project will have:

```
your-project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .mega-minds/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ memory/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ architecture.md      # System design documentation
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ recent-work.md       # Recent development log
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ sessions/            # Saved session states
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ agents/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ active-context.md    # Current agent activities
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ logs/
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ handoffs.log         # Agent coordination log
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CLAUDE.md                     # Main interface for Claude Code
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [your project files]
```

## Best Practices

1. **Start with Clear Requirements**: The more specific your initial request, the better the results
2. **Trust the Process**: Let agents hand off work naturally rather than micromanaging
3. **Save Sessions Regularly**: Use `mega-minds save-session` before major changes
4. **Monitor Token Usage**: Use `compress-context` when Claude Code mentions token limits
5. **Review Agent Decisions**: Check the decision logs to understand technical choices

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Token limit approaching"**
- Run `mega-minds compress-context` to optimize memory
- Save current session and start fresh if needed

**"Agent handoff failed"**
- Check `.mega-minds/logs/handoffs.log` for details
- Ensure all quality gates are passing
- Restart the specific agent task

**"Memory not persisting"**
- Verify `.mega-minds/` directory exists
- Check file permissions
- Run `mega-minds init` again if needed
