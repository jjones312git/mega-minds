# Mega-Minds User Guide

## Overview

Mega-minds transforms Claude Code into a complete AI development team with specialized agents for every aspect of software development - from planning to deployment.

## Core Concepts

### ü§ñ AI Development Team
- **7 specialized agents** covering all development needs
- **Intelligent agent selection** automatically chooses the best agent for each task
- **Automatic coordination** between agents with handoff tracking
- **Quality gates** ensure high-quality output at every stage
- **Memory management** prevents crashes and preserves context

### üîÑ How It Works
1. **You make a request** in Claude Code
2. **Intelligence system** analyzes the request and selects appropriate agents
3. **Selected agents** execute tasks with specialized knowledge
4. **Quality gates** validate all work before proceeding
5. **Results delivered** with complete documentation and learning feedback

## Basic Usage

### Starting a New Project

**1. Make your request:**
```
"I want to build a task management app with user authentication, 
real-time collaboration, and mobile support."
```

**2. The AI team automatically:**
- Analyzes requirements with @requirements-analysis-agent
- Creates technical architecture with @technical-architecture-agent
- Designs UI/UX with @ux-ui-design-agent
- Builds backend with @backend-development-agent
- Creates frontend with @frontend-development-agent
- Tests everything with @testing-agent
- Deploys with @ci-cd-pipeline-agent

**3. You get a complete, production-ready application**

### Memory Management

Claude Code has memory limits. Mega-minds automatically manages this:

```bash
# Check memory status
npx mega-minds memory-status

# Save current session
npx mega-minds save-session "implemented user authentication"

# Compress context when needed
npx mega-minds compress-context

# Clean up memory
npx mega-minds memory-cleanup
```

### Monitoring Progress

```bash
# See what agents are working on
npx mega-minds agent-status

# View project statistics
npx mega-minds stats

# Check system health
npx mega-minds memory-status
```

### 1. Clear Requirements
```
Good: "Build a React e-commerce site with Stripe payments, user accounts, 
       product catalog, shopping cart, and admin dashboard"

Avoid: "Make me a website"
```

### 2. Save Sessions Regularly
```bash
# Save after major milestones
npx mega-minds save-session "completed user authentication system"
npx mega-minds save-session "finished product catalog with search"
npx mega-minds save-session "deployed to production successfully"
```

### 3. Monitor Memory
```bash
# Check before starting large tasks
npx mega-minds memory-status

# Clean up if memory gets high
npx mega-minds memory-cleanup
```

### 4. Use Quality Gates
Let the AI team run quality checks:
```bash
npx mega-minds run-quality-gates
```
Don't skip quality validation - it prevents bugs and security issues.

### 5. Trust the Process
- Let agents coordinate among themselves
- The orchestrator knows which specialists to call
- Each agent has deep expertise in their domain
- Quality gates ensure everything works together
