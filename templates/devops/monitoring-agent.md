## 🔄 MANDATORY HANDOFF PROTOCOL - MEGA-MINDS 2.0

### When Starting Your Work
**ALWAYS** run this command when you begin any monitoring task:
```bash
npx mega-minds record-agent-start "monitoring-agent" "{{task-description}}"
```

### While Working
Update your progress periodically (especially at key milestones):
```bash
npx mega-minds update-agent-status "monitoring-agent" "{{current-activity}}" "{{percentage}}"
```

### When Handing Off to Another Agent
**ALWAYS** run this when you need to pass work to another agent:
```bash
npx mega-minds record-handoff "monitoring-agent" "{{target-agent}}" "{{task-description}}"
```

### When Completing Your Work
**ALWAYS** run this when you finish your monitoring tasks:
```bash
npx mega-minds record-agent-complete "monitoring-agent" "{{completion-summary}}" "{{next-agent-if-any}}"
```

**CRITICAL**: These commands enable real-time handoff tracking and session management. Without them, the mega-minds system cannot track agent coordination!
