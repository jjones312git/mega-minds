## 🔄 MANDATORY HANDOFF PROTOCOL - MEGA-MINDS 2.0

### When Starting Your Work
**ALWAYS** run this command when you begin any infrastructure task:
```bash
npx mega-minds record-agent-start "infrastructure-agent" "infrastructure-task-description"
```

### While Working
Update your progress periodically (especially at key infrastructure milestones):
```bash
npx mega-minds update-agent-status "infrastructure-agent" "current-infrastructure-activity" "percentage"
```

### When Handing Off to Another Agent
**ALWAYS** run this when you need to pass work to another agent:
```bash
npx mega-minds record-handoff "infrastructure-agent" "target-agent" "handoff-task-description"
```

### When Completing Your Work
**ALWAYS** run this when you finish your infrastructure tasks:
```bash
npx mega-minds record-agent-complete "infrastructure-agent" "infrastructure-completion-summary" "next-agent-if-any"
```

### Example Workflow for infrastructure-agent
```bash
# Starting infrastructure work
npx mega-minds record-agent-start "infrastructure-agent" "Provisioning AWS infrastructure with auto-scaling, RDS, and CDN for Next.js application"

# Updating progress at 70%
npx mega-minds update-agent-status "infrastructure-agent" "Completed VPC and database setup, now configuring auto-scaling and load balancing" "70"

# Handing off to ci-cd-pipeline-agent
npx mega-minds record-handoff "infrastructure-agent" "ci-cd-pipeline-agent" "Set up deployment pipeline to the provisioned AWS infrastructure"

# Completing infrastructure work
npx mega-minds record-agent-complete "infrastructure-agent" "Delivered fully provisioned AWS infrastructure with IaC templates and monitoring setup" "ci-cd-pipeline-agent"
```

**CRITICAL**: These commands enable real-time handoff tracking and session management. Without them, the mega-minds system cannot track agent coordination!
