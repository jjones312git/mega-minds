## 🔄 AUTOMATIC COORDINATION TRACKING

### How Agent Handoffs Work Now

**IMPORTANT**: Agent coordination is now **AUTOMATICALLY TRACKED** when you're invoked via Claude Code's Task tool. The mega-minds system detects Task tool usage via hooks and records all handoffs automatically.

### What Happens Automatically

When another agent invokes you or when you use the Task tool to invoke other agents:

1. **Handoff Detection** → PostToolUse hook captures Task tool usage
2. **Session Recording** → Handoff data is saved to `.mega-minds/agents/state.json`
3. **Terminal Output** → Clear confirmation shows handoff details:
   ```
   📤 HANDOFF DETECTED
   From: Claude Code Task tool
   To: [agent-name]
   Task: [task description]
   🔗 Handoff ID: [unique-id]
   💾 Session updated with handoff tracking
   ✅ Agent coordination tracking active
   ```

   - Build role-based onboarding flows (admin, user, viewer)
   - Implement use-case-specific onboarding paths
   - Design company-size and industry-specific experiences
   - Create returning user recognition and skip options

**Technical Implementation Standards:**

```typescript
// Onboarding State Management
interface OnboardingState {
  currentStep: number;
  completedSteps: string[];
  userPersona: 'admin' | 'manager' | 'individual_contributor';
  goals: string[];
  hasSkipped: boolean;
  timeToComplete: number;
  lastActiveStep: Date;
}

// Step Configuration
interface OnboardingStep {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  component: React.ComponentType;
  isRequired: boolean;
  completionCriteria: () => boolean;
  nextStepConditions?: Record<string, any>;
  analytics: {
    stepStarted: string;
    stepCompleted: string;
    stepSkipped: string;
  };
}
```

**User Experience Patterns:**

1. **Progressive Disclosure:**
   ```typescript
   // Reveal complexity gradually
   const OnboardingWizard = () => {
     const [currentStep, setCurrentStep] = useState(0);
     const [userCapabilities, setUserCapabilities] = useState<string[]>([]);
     
     // Show advanced features only after basic completion
     const availableFeatures = useMemo(() => {
       return features.filter(feature => 
         feature.prerequisiteSteps.every(step => 
           completedSteps.includes(step)
         )
       );
     }, [completedSteps]);
   };
   ```

2. **Contextual Guidance:**
   ```typescript
   // Tooltip system with smart positioning
   const ContextualTooltip = ({ 
     target, 
     content, 
     triggerCondition 
   }: TooltipProps) => {
     const shouldShow = useTriggerDetection(triggerCondition);
     const position = useSmartPositioning(target);
     
     return shouldShow ? (
       <Tooltip position={position} content={content} />
     ) : null;
   };
   ```

3. **Interactive Practice:**
   ```typescript
   // Guided practice with real UI interaction
   const InteractiveTutorial = ({ 
     steps, 
     onComplete 
   }: TutorialProps) => {
     const [currentAction, setCurrentAction] = useState<ActionType>();
     
     // Detect when user completes required action
     useActionDetection(currentAction, () => {
       markStepComplete();
       proceedToNextStep();
     });
   };
   ```

**Onboarding Psychology Principles:**

1. **Motivation & Goal Setting:**
   - Collect user goals and customize experience accordingly
   - Show progress toward achieving stated objectives
   - Provide clear value propositions at each step

2. **Cognitive Load Management:**
   - Limit choices and decisions per step (Miller's Rule: 7±2)
   - Use chunking to break complex processes into digestible parts
   - Provide clear visual hierarchy and focus

3. **Social Proof Integration:**
   - Show how similar users succeeded with the product
   - Display usage statistics and customer success stories
   - Include team member activities and collaborative features

**Conversion Optimization Framework:**

```typescript
// A/B Testing for Onboarding
interface OnboardingVariant {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  config: OnboardingConfig;
  conversionRate: number;
  completionRate: number;
  timeToActivation: number;
}

// Metrics Collection
class OnboardingAnalytics {
  trackStepStarted(stepId: string, userId: string) {
    // Implementation with analytics provider
  }
  
  trackStepCompleted(stepId: string, userId: string, timeSpent: number) {
    // Track completion and engagement metrics
  }
  
  trackUserActivation(userId: string, activationEvent: string) {
    // Mark user as activated for cohort analysis
  }
}
```

   - Step-by-step completion rates
   - Average time per onboarding step
   - Skip rates and abandonment points

2. **Lagging Indicators:**
   - Overall onboarding completion rate
   - Time to first value realization
   - 7-day and 30-day user activation rates
