# [PROJECT_NAME] - AI Development Team Memory

## IMPORTANT: Mega Minds Integration

**This project uses the mega-minds NPM package for AI team coordination.**

The mega-minds package provides:
- Core AI team functionality (SessionManager, TokenManager, MemoryManager, etc.)
- Command-line tools for memory and session management
- Agent coordination and state tracking

These core files are located in: `node_modules/mega-minds/lib/`

## Memory Management Commands

**For Claude Code - Use these commands when needed:**
- `npx mega-minds compress-context` - When approaching token limits
- `npx mega-minds save-session "description"` - Save current development session
- `npx mega-minds load-session` - Load previous session state
- `npx mega-minds agent-status` - See what agents are working on
- `npx mega-minds update-memory "what happened"` - Update project memory
- `npx mega-minds memory-status` - Check memory health
- `npx mega-minds memory-cleanup` - Force memory cleanup

# Multi-Agent Development Team Workflow

## Overview

This is your AI development team that works together to build complete applications. Each agent specializes in different aspects of software development, from planning to deployment.

## How This Works

1. **Always start with @project-orchestrator-agent** - The orchestrator who coordinates everything
2. **Agents MUST be invoked using the Task tool** - No direct implementation by orchestrator
3. **Mandatory handoff protocol** - All agent transitions must follow communication-protocol.md
4. **Quality gates BLOCK progression** - Failed gates prevent work from continuing
5. **Decision councils help** make smart technical choices
6. **Problem-solving swarms** fix issues fast when things break

## Core Principles

- **Sequential Handoffs**: Requirements ‚Üí Design ‚Üí Development ‚Üí Testing ‚Üí Deployment
- **Parallel Collaboration**: Multiple agents work simultaneously on independent components
- **Quality First**: Multiple checkpoints ensure high-quality deliverables
- **Expert Consultation**: Specialists provide input during other agents' work
- **Strict Role Boundaries**: Agents MUST NOT perform work outside their defined scope
- **Task Tool Enforcement**: All agent work MUST be performed through the Task tool

## MEMORY-SAFE COORDINATION üß†

**NEW RULE**: Maximum 3 concurrent agents to prevent crashes
**Strategy**: Sequential phases with mandatory checkpoints
**Commands**: 
- `mega-minds save-session "phase name"` - Between ALL phases
- `mega-minds compress-context` - When switching focus areas

## Quality Gate System üõ°Ô∏è

Every piece of work must pass quality checks before moving forward.

**Before Any Code Deployment:**
- ‚úÖ Code Review (by @code-review-agent)
- ‚úÖ Testing (by @testing-agent) 
- ‚úÖ Security Scan (by @security-testing-agent)

**Before Any Design Implementation:**
- ‚úÖ Architecture Approval (by @technical-architecture-agent)
- ‚úÖ User Experience Review (by @ux-ui-design-agent)

See `workflows/quality-gates.md` for complete details.

## Decision Making Process üèõÔ∏è

For major technical decisions, we convene expert councils to ensure the best choices.

**Use Decision Councils For:**
- Technology stack selection
- Architecture changes
- Security implementations
- Performance optimizations

See `workflows/decision-councils.md` for templates and processes.

## Emergency Response System üö®

When critical issues arise, we activate problem-solving swarms for rapid response.

**Swarm Types:**
- Performance issues
- Security incidents  
- Critical bugs
- System outages

See `workflows/problem-solving-swarms.md` for activation procedures.

```
üèõÔ∏è DECISION COUNCIL: Database Selection üèõÔ∏è

<function_calls>
<invoke name="Task">
<parameter name="subagent_type">general-purpose</parameter>

**User Request**: "We need to add real-time notifications to our task management app. Users should get notified when tasks are assigned, completed, or overdue."

**CORRECT Multi-Agent Workflow**:
```
<function_calls>
<invoke name="Task">
<parameter name="subagent_type">general-purpose</parameter>
<parameter name="description">Real-time notifications feature coordination</parameter>
<parameter name="prompt">## Handoff to @project-orchestrator-agent

## Getting Help

If you're unsure which agent to use or how to structure a request:
1. Start with @project-orchestrator-agent - they can guide you to the right specialists
2. Be specific about your requirements and constraints
3. Trust the process - let agents call each other as needed
4. Review the workflow files for templates and examples

Remember: This is a collaborative process. The agents work together to deliver the best possible solution for your needs!

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL ENFORCEMENT RULES ‚ö†Ô∏è

### Project Orchestrator Constraints

The **@project-orchestrator-agent** is LIMITED to coordination activities only:

**ORCHESTRATOR MUST DO**:
- Plan and break down work into tasks
- Assign work to appropriate specialized agents using Task tool
- Coordinate handoffs between agents
- Track progress and manage todo lists
- Escalate conflicts to decision councils
- Ensure quality gates are followed

**ORCHESTRATOR MUST NOT DO**:
- Write code, HTML, CSS, or configuration files
- Perform database operations or data analysis
- Create UI designs or user interfaces
- Execute tests or deployment procedures  
- Make technical implementation decisions
- Bypass agent handoff protocols

**VIOLATION PENALTY**: Any implementation work by the orchestrator MUST be immediately stopped and handed off to the appropriate specialist agent.

### Task Tool Enforcement

**ALL AGENT WORK MUST USE TASK TOOL**:

When invoking any agent, MUST use this exact format:
```
Task tool with:
- subagent_type: "general-purpose"
- description: "Brief task description"
- prompt: "## Handoff to @[agent-name]
[Full handoff using communication-protocol.md template]"
```

**PROHIBITED**: Direct mentions like @agent-name without Task tool invocation

**REQUIRED**: Every agent handoff MUST include:
1. Visual activation marker: "ü§ñ @[agent-name] ACTIVE"
2. Complete handoff template from communication-protocol.md
3. Clear success criteria and acceptance conditions
4. Quality gate requirements before completion

See `workflows/compliance-enforcement.md` for violation handling procedures.
