# Mega-Minds Critical Enforcement Rules

**‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY COMPLIANCE - VIOLATION PENALTIES APPLY ‚ö†Ô∏è**

This document contains critical rules that MUST be followed for proper mega-minds operation. Violations of these rules will result in immediate corrective action and may cause system failures.

---

## Core System Rules

### Rule 1: Memory Safety Protocol üß†
**ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM**: 2 concurrent agents (including orchestrator)  
**RATIONALE**: Prevents Claude Code memory crashes and ensures stable operation  
**ENFORCEMENT**: Automatic rejection of agent activation requests when limit exceeded  

**Required Actions**:
- Check memory before activating agents: `npx mega-minds memory-status`
- Save sessions between major phases: `npx mega-minds save-session "description"`
- Compress context when approaching limits: `npx mega-minds compress-context`

**VIOLATION PENALTY**: System will automatically deactivate agents to maintain stability

---

### Rule 2: Task Tool Enforcement üîß
**MANDATORY**: ALL agent work MUST use Task tool  
**PROHIBITED**: Direct agent mentions like `@agent-name` without Task tool invocation  
**RATIONALE**: Ensures proper agent coordination and state tracking  

**Required Format**:
```markdown
<function_calls>
<invoke name="Task">
<parameter name="subagent_type">[actual-agent-name]</parameter>
<parameter name="description">Brief task description</parameter>
<parameter name="prompt">## Handoff to @[agent-name]
[Complete handoff using communication-protocol.md template]
</parameter>
</invoke>
</function_calls>
```

**CRITICAL**: Use the exact agent name, not "general-purpose":
- ‚úÖ `frontend-development-agent`, `database-schema-agent`, etc.
- ‚ùå `general-purpose` (will cause handoff failures)

**Required Elements in Every Handoff**:
1. Visual activation marker: `ü§ñ @[agent-name] ACTIVE`
2. Complete handoff template from communication-protocol.md
3. Clear success criteria and acceptance conditions
4. Quality gate requirements before completion

**VIOLATION PENALTY**: Direct mentions will be ignored; proper Task tool invocation required

---

### Rule 3: Project Orchestrator Constraints üéØ
**CRITICAL LIMITATION**: The @project-orchestrator-agent is LIMITED to coordination activities ONLY

#### Orchestrator MUST DO:
‚úÖ Plan and break down work into tasks  
‚úÖ Assign work to appropriate specialized agents using Task tool  
‚úÖ Coordinate handoffs between agents  
‚úÖ Track progress and manage todo lists  
‚úÖ Escalate conflicts to decision councils  
‚úÖ Ensure quality gates are followed  

#### Orchestrator MUST NOT DO:
‚ùå Write code, HTML, CSS, or configuration files  
‚ùå Perform database operations or data analysis  
‚ùå Create UI designs or user interfaces  
‚ùå Execute tests or deployment procedures  
‚ùå Make technical implementation decisions  
‚ùå Bypass agent handoff protocols  

**VIOLATION PENALTY**: Any implementation work by the orchestrator MUST be immediately stopped and handed off to the appropriate specialist agent

---

### Rule 4: Quality Gate Compliance üõ°Ô∏è
**MANDATORY**: Every piece of work must pass quality checks before progression  
**BLOCKING BEHAVIOR**: Failed gates prevent work from continuing  
**RATIONALE**: Ensures professional-grade output and prevents defects  

**Before Any Code Deployment**:
- ‚úÖ Code Review (by @code-review-agent)
- ‚úÖ Testing (by @testing-agent)
- ‚úÖ Security Scan (by @security-testing-agent)

**Before Any Design Implementation**:
- ‚úÖ Architecture Approval (by @technical-architecture-agent)
- ‚úÖ User Experience Review (by @ux-ui-design-agent)

**VIOLATION PENALTY**: Work progression blocked until all quality gates pass

---

### Rule 5: Agent Role Boundaries üöß
**STRICT ENFORCEMENT**: Agents MUST NOT perform work outside their defined scope  
**RATIONALE**: Prevents role confusion and ensures expert-level output  
**REFERENCE**: See `workflows/agent-boundaries.md` for detailed boundaries  

**Example Violations**:
- Frontend agent performing database operations
- Testing agent writing production code
- Design agent implementing security features

**VIOLATION PENALTY**: Work must be transferred to appropriate specialist agent

---

## Communication Protocol Rules

### Rule 6: Mandatory Handoff Protocol üìã
**REQUIREMENT**: All agent transitions must follow communication-protocol.md templates  
**COMPONENTS**:
- Proper context transfer
- Clear task definition
- Success criteria specification
- Quality gate requirements

**VIOLATION PENALTY**: Handoff rejection until proper protocol followed

---

### Rule 7: Sequential Phase Management ‚è≠Ô∏è
**STRATEGY**: Sequential phases with mandatory checkpoints  
**REQUIRED FLOW**: Requirements ‚Üí Design ‚Üí Development ‚Üí Testing ‚Üí Deployment  
**CHECKPOINTS**: Session saves required between ALL phases  

**VIOLATION PENALTY**: Phase progression blocked until checkpoint completed

---

## Emergency Protocols

### Rule 8: Memory Crisis Response üö®
**TRIGGER CONDITIONS**:
- Memory usage >3.5GB
- Multiple memory warnings
- Claude Code performance degradation

**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS**:
1. Save current session immediately
2. Compress context aggressively
3. Reduce concurrent agents to 1
4. Consider Claude Code restart if critical

**AUTHORITY**: Any agent can trigger emergency protocol when memory critical

---

### Rule 9: Agent Failure Recovery üîÑ
**FAILURE CONDITIONS**:
- Agent non-responsiveness >5 minutes
- Repeated handoff failures
- Quality gate failures >3 attempts

**RECOVERY PROCEDURE**:
1. Log failure details
2. Reset agent state
3. Re-initiate handoff with fresh context
4. Escalate to orchestrator if pattern continues

---

### Rule 10: System Override Authority üîì
**OVERRIDE CONDITIONS**:
- Critical production issues
- Emergency bug fixes
- System stability threats

**AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL**:
- Project orchestrator agent
- System administrators
- Emergency response teams

**PROCEDURE**:
1. Document override reason
2. Implement minimum viable fix
3. Return to normal protocols ASAP
4. Post-incident review required

---

## Compliance Monitoring

### Violation Detection üïµÔ∏è
- Automated monitoring of agent behavior
- Real-time rule compliance checking
- Violation logging and reporting
- Pattern analysis for repeat violations

### Enforcement Actions ‚öñÔ∏è
**Level 1 - Warning**: Rule reminder and guidance  
**Level 2 - Correction**: Forced compliance with proper procedure  
**Level 3 - Blocking**: Prevention of non-compliant actions  
**Level 4 - Reset**: Agent state reset and handoff restart  

### Escalation Path üìà
1. Automated compliance system
2. Project orchestrator agent
3. System administrators
4. Emergency response protocols

---

## Rule Update Process üîÑ

### Version Control
- All rule changes tracked with semantic versioning
- Change log maintained with rationale
- Backward compatibility considerations
- Migration guides for major changes

### Approval Process
- Technical review required for all changes
- Impact assessment on existing workflows
- Testing with representative scenarios
- Staged rollout with monitoring

### Communication
- Rule changes communicated to all agents
- Training updates for complex changes
- Documentation updates across all files
- User notification for critical changes

---

## Quick Reference Card üéØ

### Critical Commands
```bash
npx mega-minds memory-status     # Check before agent activation
npx mega-minds save-session      # Required between phases  
npx mega-minds compress-context  # When memory warnings appear
npx mega-minds agent-status      # Monitor concurrent agents
```

### Critical Limits
- **Max Concurrent Agents**: 2 (including orchestrator)
- **Memory Threshold**: <3.5GB before emergency protocols
- **Handoff Timeout**: 5 minutes before failure escalation
- **Quality Gate Retries**: 3 attempts before escalation

### Emergency Contacts
- **System Issues**: Check `workflows/compliance-enforcement.md`
- **Rule Violations**: See violation handling procedures
- **Technical Support**: Contact system administrators
- **Critical Failures**: Activate emergency response protocols
