**RESTful API Design Standards:**

**Resource Naming Conventions:**
- Use nouns for resources: `/users`, `/orders`, `/products`
- Use plural nouns consistently
- Use kebab-case for multi-word resources: `/order-items`
- Nest resources logically: `/users/{id}/orders`
- Use query parameters for filtering: `/users?role=admin`

**HTTP Methods and Status Codes:**
```
GET /users          → 200 OK (list users)
GET /users/{id}     → 200 OK, 404 Not Found
POST /users         → 201 Created, 400 Bad Request
PUT /users/{id}     → 200 OK, 404 Not Found
PATCH /users/{id}   → 200 OK, 404 Not Found
DELETE /users/{id}  → 204 No Content, 404 Not Found
```

**Response Format Standards:**
```json
{
  "data": {...},           // Main response payload
  "meta": {                // Metadata about the response
    "pagination": {...},
    "total": 150,
    "page": 1
  },
  "links": {               // HATEOAS navigation links
    "self": "/users?page=1",
    "next": "/users?page=2",
    "prev": null
  }
}
```

**Error Response Standards:**
```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
    "message": "The request data is invalid",
    "details": [
      {
        "field": "email",
        "message": "Email address is required"
      }
    ],
    "request_id": "req_123456789"
  }
}
```

**GraphQL Schema Design:**

**Type Definitions:**
```graphql
type User {
  id: ID!
  email: String!
  profile: UserProfile
  orders(first: Int, after: String): OrderConnection!
}

type Query {
  user(id: ID!): User
  users(filter: UserFilter, sort: UserSort): [User!]!
}

type Mutation {
  createUser(input: CreateUserInput!): CreateUserPayload!
  updateUser(id: ID!, input: UpdateUserInput!): UpdateUserPayload!
}
```

**Query Optimization:**
- Design efficient resolvers with DataLoader patterns
- Implement query complexity analysis and limits
- Create optimized database queries for nested resolvers
- Plan query caching strategies and invalidation
- Design subscription patterns for real-time updates

**Authentication and Authorization Patterns:**

**JWT Token Strategy:**
```json
{
  "access_token": "eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGc...",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "expires_in": 3600,
  "refresh_token": "def50200a54b97e...",
  "scope": "read write"
}
```

**OAuth 2.0 Flows:**
- Authorization Code Flow for web applications
- Client Credentials Flow for server-to-server
- PKCE for mobile and SPA applications
- Device Authorization Flow for IoT devices

**API Key Management:**
- Scoped API keys with specific permissions
- Rate limiting per API key
- Usage analytics and monitoring
- Key rotation and lifecycle management

**Versioning Strategies:**

**URL Versioning:**
- `/v1/users`, `/v2/users`
- Clear version identification
- Easy routing and caching
- Potential URL pollution

**Header Versioning:**
- `Accept: application/vnd.api+json;version=2`
- Clean URLs maintained
- More complex routing
- Better content negotiation

**Backwards Compatibility:**
- Additive changes only in minor versions
- Deprecation warnings and sunset dates
- Migration guides and tools
- Versioned client libraries

**Performance Optimization:**

**Caching Strategies:**
- HTTP caching headers (ETag, Cache-Control)
- Redis/Memcached for response caching
- CDN caching for static API responses
- Query result caching with invalidation

**Rate Limiting:**
```http
X-RateLimit-Limit: 1000
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 999
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1609459200
```

**Pagination Patterns:**
```json
{
  "data": [...],
  "pagination": {
    "page": 1,
    "per_page": 20,
    "total": 150,
    "total_pages": 8
  },
  "links": {
    "first": "/users?page=1",
    "last": "/users?page=8",
    "prev": null,
    "next": "/users?page=2"
  }
}
```

**Real-Time API Design:**

**WebSocket Patterns:**
- Connection authentication and authorization
- Message format standardization
- Error handling and reconnection logic
- Scaling considerations with message brokers

**Webhook Design:**
- Event payload standardization
- Signature verification for security
- Retry logic and failure handling
- Webhook registration and management APIs

**Quality Assurance Standards:**

Before finalizing API designs, verify:
- ✓ **Consistency**: Follows established patterns and conventions
- ✓ **Security**: Authentication and authorization properly implemented
- ✓ **Performance**: Optimized for expected load patterns
- ✓ **Documentation**: Comprehensive and accurate API documentation
- ✓ **Testing**: Automated test coverage for all endpoints
- ✓ **Versioning**: Clear versioning strategy and backward compatibility
- ✓ **Error Handling**: Consistent error responses and status codes

**Integration Patterns:**

**Third-Party Integrations:**
- OAuth provider integration flows
- Payment gateway API patterns
- Email service provider APIs
- Cloud storage and CDN integrations
- Analytics and monitoring service APIs

**Microservices Communication:**
- Service-to-service authentication
