**Authentication Architecture:**

**Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**
```
Primary Factor: Password/Passkey
Secondary Factors:
- SMS/Email OTP (less secure, avoid when possible)
- TOTP (Google Authenticator, Authy)
- Push notifications (mobile app)
- Hardware tokens (YubiKey, FIDO2)
- Biometric verification (when available)
```

**OAuth 2.0 Implementation:**
```
Authorization Code Flow (Web Applications):
1. User redirected to authorization server
2. User authenticates and grants consent
3. Authorization code returned to redirect URI
4. Client exchanges code for access token
5. Client uses access token for API requests

PKCE Flow (Mobile/SPA):
- Code challenge and verifier for enhanced security
- No client secret required
- Protection against authorization code interception
```

**Session Management:**
```
Session Security Controls:
- HttpOnly and Secure cookie flags
- SameSite attribute for CSRF protection
- Session timeout and idle timeout
- Concurrent session limits
- Session invalidation on security events
```

**Authorization Patterns:**

**Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**
```
Users → Roles → Permissions → Resources

Example:
- User: john@company.com
- Roles: [admin, billing_manager]
- Permissions: [read_users, write_billing, delete_invoices]
- Resources: [/admin/*, /billing/*, /invoices/:id]
```

**Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC):**
```
Policy: Allow access if:
- User role = "manager"
- Resource type = "report"
- Time = business_hours
- Location = approved_networks
- Data classification = "internal"
```

**Data Protection Standards:**

**Encryption Implementation:**
```
At Rest:
- AES-256-GCM for database encryption
- RSA-4096 or ECDSA P-384 for key exchange
- ChaCha20-Poly1305 for high-performance scenarios

In Transit:
- TLS 1.3 for all HTTP communications
- Certificate pinning for mobile applications
- Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) enabled
- Strong cipher suite configuration
```

**Key Management:**
```
Key Lifecycle:
1. Generation using cryptographically secure RNG
2. Distribution through secure key exchange
3. Storage in hardware security modules (HSM) or key vaults
4. Rotation based on time and usage policies
5. Revocation and secure destruction

Key Hierarchy:
- Master keys (HSM-protected)
- Data encryption keys (rotated regularly)
- Application keys (scoped and limited)
```

**Compliance Framework Implementation:**

**GDPR Compliance Architecture:**
```
Data Subject Rights Implementation:
- Right to access: User data export APIs
- Right to rectification: Data update mechanisms
- Right to erasure: Secure data deletion procedures
- Right to portability: Standardized data export formats
- Right to restrict processing: Data processing controls

Technical Measures:
- Pseudonymization and anonymization
- Data minimization and purpose limitation
- Privacy by design and by default
- Data protection impact assessments (DPIA)
- Breach notification within 72 hours
```

**SOC 2 Type II Controls:**
```
Security Controls:
- Access controls and user management
- System monitoring and logging
- Vulnerability management programs
- Incident response procedures
- Vendor risk management

Availability Controls:
- System monitoring and alerting
- Backup and disaster recovery
- Capacity planning and performance monitoring
- Change management procedures

Confidentiality Controls:
- Data encryption and key management
- Access controls and authorization
- Secure data transmission and storage

```

**API Security Implementation:**

**Rate Limiting Strategies:**
```
Sliding Window Rate Limiting:
- Requests per second/minute/hour limits
- Different limits based on authentication status
- Progressive backoff for abuse detection
- IP-based and user-based limiting

Token Bucket Algorithm:
- Burst traffic accommodation
- Smooth rate limiting over time
- Configurable bucket size and refill rate
```

**API Security Headers:**
```http
# Security Headers
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff

# API-Specific Headers
X-RateLimit-Limit: 1000
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 999
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1609459200
```

**Input Validation and Security:**
```
Validation Strategies:
- Whitelist-based input validation
- Parameterized queries for SQL injection prevention
- Output encoding for XSS prevention
- File upload validation and sandboxing
- Request size and complexity limits
```

**Security Monitoring Architecture:**

**Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):**
```
Log Sources:
- Application security events
- Authentication and authorization logs
- Database access logs
- Network traffic analysis
- Infrastructure and system logs
