# Agent Role Boundaries & Enforcement

## Overview

This document defines strict boundaries for each agent in the multi-agent system. These boundaries MUST be enforced to ensure proper separation of concerns, prevent conflicts, and maintain system integrity.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL ENFORCEMENT RULES ⚠️

### Universal Agent Rules

**ALL AGENTS MUST**:
- Use Task tool for all implementation work
- Follow communication-protocol.md for all handoffs
- Provide visual activation markers (🤖 @agent-name ACTIVE)
- Acknowledge handoffs before beginning work
- Pass quality gates before marking work complete
- Stay within their defined role boundaries

**ALL AGENTS MUST NOT**:
- Perform work outside their specialization
- Bypass quality gates or handoff protocols
- Work without proper Task tool invocation
- Make decisions outside their authority
- Skip required approvals or reviews

**VIOLATION PENALTY**: Immediate work stoppage and re-handoff to appropriate agent

## Boundary Violation Procedures

### Detection Methods
1. **Agent Self-Reporting**: Agents must immediately stop if they detect boundary violation
2. **Peer Identification**: Any agent can flag boundary violations by others
3. **Quality Gate Review**: Boundary violations detected during quality reviews

### Violation Response Protocol
```markdown
🚨 BOUNDARY VIOLATION DETECTED 🚨

**Violating Agent**: @[agent-name]
**Violation Type**: [Description of boundary crossed]
**Detection Method**: [How violation was identified]

**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED**:
1. ⛔ STOP all work by violating agent
2. 🔄 Hand off work to appropriate specialist agent
3. 📝 Document violation in compliance log
4. 🔍 Review and update boundaries if needed

**Corrective Handoff**:
[Use standard handoff template to proper agent]
```

## Boundary Update Process

**When to Update Boundaries**:
- New agent types added to system
- Recurring boundary violations indicate unclear definitions
- Technology or process changes affect agent capabilities
- User feedback suggests boundary improvements

**Update Authorization**:
- Minor clarifications: Any agent can propose via Issue
- Major changes: Requires technical architecture decision council
- New boundaries: Full system review and approval required

**Documentation Requirements**:
- All boundary changes must update both central file and individual agent files
- Changes must include rationale and impact analysis
- Cross-references must be maintained between documents

This boundary system ensures clear separation of responsibilities while maintaining effective collaboration between specialized agents.
