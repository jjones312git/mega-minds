# Decision Councils System

## Overview

Decision Councils are specialized groups of expert agents convened to make critical technical decisions that impact multiple aspects of the system. Rather than having individual agents make decisions in isolation, councils ensure all perspectives are considered and the best possible choice is made for the overall project.
