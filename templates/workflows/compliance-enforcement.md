# Multi-Agent System Compliance Enforcement

## Overview

This document defines the enforcement mechanisms, violation detection methods, and corrective procedures for the multi-agent workflow system. Compliance with the established protocols is mandatory and violations must be immediately corrected.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Primary Enforcement Agents**:
- **@project-orchestrator-agent**: Overall system compliance monitoring
- **@code-review-agent**: Code and implementation compliance
- **@testing-agent**: Quality gate compliance
- **All Agents**: Peer monitoring and self-reporting violations

**Escalation Authority**: **@technical-architecture-agent** has final authority on compliance disputes

## Compliance Categories

### 1. Protocol Violations

#### Task Tool Enforcement Violations
**Rule**: All agent work MUST use Task tool invocation
**Common Violations**:
- Direct @agent-name mentions without Task tool
- Orchestrator performing implementation work directly
- Agents working without proper handoff

**Detection Triggers**:
- Agent performs work without visual activation marker
- Code/files created without Task tool record
- Missing handoff acknowledgment

**Immediate Response**:
```markdown
üö® PROTOCOL VIOLATION: Task Tool Bypass

**Violating Agent**: @[agent-name]
**Violation**: [Specific violation description]
**Evidence**: [What was done incorrectly]

‚õî IMMEDIATE STOP WORK ORDER ‚õî

**Required Actions**:
1. Stop all current work immediately
2. Revert any implementation work to pre-violation state
3. Initiate proper handoff using Task tool
4. Document violation in compliance log

**Correct Procedure**:
[Show proper Task tool usage]
```

#### Handoff Protocol Violations
**Rule**: All handoffs must follow communication-protocol.md template
**Common Violations**:
- Incomplete handoff information
- Missing success criteria or dependencies
- No handoff acknowledgment from receiving agent
- Skipping required visual markers

**Detection Triggers**:
- Agent begins work without acknowledgment
- Missing handoff documentation
- Incomplete context or requirements

**Immediate Response**:
```markdown
üö® HANDOFF VIOLATION: Incomplete Protocol

**Violating Parties**: @[sender-agent] ‚Üí @[receiver-agent]
**Violation**: [Specific handoff issue]
**Missing Elements**: [What was omitted]

‚õî WORK SUSPENSION ‚õî

**Required Actions**:
1. Suspend all work on transferred task
2. Return task to sender for proper handoff
3. Complete full handoff template
4. Obtain proper acknowledgment before proceeding

**Handoff Retry Required**: YES
```

### 2. Role Boundary Violations

#### Agent Scope Violations
**Rule**: Agents MUST NOT perform work outside defined boundaries
**Common Violations**:
- Frontend agent doing backend work
- Orchestrator writing code directly
- Testing agent fixing bugs instead of reporting
- Design agent implementing HTML/CSS

**Detection Triggers**:
- Agent creates files outside their scope
- Work performed without appropriate specialist
- Quality gates bypassed by wrong agent type

**Immediate Response**:
```markdown
üö® BOUNDARY VIOLATION: Role Overreach

**Violating Agent**: @[agent-name]
**Attempted Work**: [What work was performed]
**Correct Agent**: @[appropriate-agent-name]

‚õî WORK NULLIFICATION ‚õî

**Required Actions**:
1. Revert all work performed outside agent scope
2. Hand off task to appropriate specialist agent
3. Document violation and correct boundaries
4. Update agent boundaries if unclear

**Work Status**: INVALID - Must be redone by appropriate agent
```

### 3. Quality Gate Violations

#### Quality Gate Bypass
**Rule**: Quality gates CANNOT be skipped or circumvented
**Common Violations**:
- Deploying code without code review
- Moving to production without security scan
- Proceeding with failed test results
- Skipping required documentation

**Detection Triggers**:
- Deployment without quality gate approvals
- Code changes without review status
- Missing test results or security clearance

**Immediate Response**:
```markdown
üö® QUALITY VIOLATION: Gate Bypass

**Violating Agent**: @[agent-name]
**Bypassed Gate**: [Which quality gate was skipped]
**Risk Level**: [Critical/High/Medium]

‚õî IMMEDIATE ROLLBACK REQUIRED ‚õî

**Required Actions**:
1. Stop all deployment/progression immediately
2. Rollback to last known good state
3. Complete ALL required quality gates
4. Re-validate entire change before proceeding

**Deployment Status**: BLOCKED until all gates pass
```

## Violation Detection Methods

### 1. Automated Detection
**File Creation Monitoring**:
- Track which agent created each file
- Validate agent has authority for file type
- Flag files created without Task tool record

**Handoff Tracking**:
- Monitor Task tool usage patterns
- Detect missing acknowledgments
- Identify incomplete handoff templates

**Quality Gate Status**:
- Track approval status for all work
- Monitor for deployment without approvals
- Alert on bypassed or incomplete reviews

### 2. Peer Monitoring
**Agent Responsibilities**:
- Report violations by other agents
- Flag unclear or missing boundaries
- Escalate compliance concerns immediately

**Reporting Template**:
```markdown
üìã COMPLIANCE CONCERN REPORT

**Reporting Agent**: @[reporter-name]
**Target Agent**: @[target-agent]
**Concern Type**: [Protocol/Boundary/Quality]
**Description**: [Detailed description of concern]
**Evidence**: [Supporting information]
**Urgency**: [High/Medium/Low]

**Recommended Action**: [Suggested resolution]
```

### 3. Self-Reporting
**Agent Responsibilities**:
- Immediately report own violations
- Stop work when boundary unclear
- Request clarification before proceeding

**Self-Report Template**:
```markdown
üîç SELF-REPORTED VIOLATION

**Agent**: @[agent-name]
**Violation Type**: [What rule was broken]
**Circumstances**: [How violation occurred]
**Impact**: [What was affected]
**Mitigation**: [Steps already taken]

**Status**: Awaiting guidance for correction
```

## Corrective Procedures

### 1. Minor Violations (Process)
**Examples**: Missing visual markers, incomplete templates
**Response Time**: Immediate correction
**Authority**: Any peer agent can flag

**Correction Steps**:
1. Flag violation and stop current work
2. Correct the process error
3. Resume work with proper procedures
4. Document lesson learned

### 2. Major Violations (Boundary/Quality)
**Examples**: Role boundary violations, quality gate bypass
**Response Time**: Immediate stoppage and rollback
**Authority**: Enforcement agents + escalation

**Correction Steps**:
1. Immediate work stoppage
2. Revert all violating work
3. Re-handoff to appropriate agent
4. Complete proper procedures
5. Document violation for process improvement

### 3. Critical Violations (Security/Safety)
**Examples**: Security bypass, production deployment without approval
**Response Time**: Emergency response protocol
**Authority**: System architect + immediate escalation

**Correction Steps**:
1. Emergency system protection
2. Immediate rollback/containment
3. Full incident response protocol
4. System-wide review and updates
5. Preventive measures implementation

- Critical security or safety violations
- Repeated violations by same agent
- Unclear or conflicting boundaries
- System-wide compliance breakdown

### Escalation Chain
1. **Peer Agent** ‚Üí Report to enforcement agents
2. **Enforcement Agents** ‚Üí Escalate to system architect
3. **System Architect** ‚Üí Convene emergency decision council
4. **Decision Council** ‚Üí System-wide corrective action
