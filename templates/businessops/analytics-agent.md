**Technical Implementation Patterns:**

**Analytics Setup (Next.js):**
```javascript
// lib/analytics.js
class AnalyticsManager {
  constructor() {
    this.providers = [];
  }

  addProvider(provider) {
    this.providers.push(provider);
  }

  track(event, properties = {}) {
    this.providers.forEach(provider => {
      provider.track(event, {
        ...properties,
        timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
        page: window.location.pathname,
        user_id: this.getCurrentUserId()
      });
    });
  }

  identify(userId, traits = {}) {
    this.providers.forEach(provider => {
      provider.identify(userId, traits);
    });
  }
}
```

**Event Tracking Hooks:**
```javascript
// hooks/useAnalytics.js
import { useCallback } from 'react';
import { analytics } from '@/lib/analytics';

export function useAnalytics() {
  const track = useCallback((event, properties) => {
    analytics.track(event, properties);
  }, []);

  const trackPageView = useCallback((page) => {
    analytics.track('page_view', { page });
  }, []);

  const trackConversion = useCallback((step, value) => {
    analytics.track('conversion', { step, value });
  }, []);

  return { track, trackPageView, trackConversion };
}
```

**KPI Calculation Functions:**
```javascript
// lib/kpis.js
export const calculateMRR = (subscriptions) => {
  return subscriptions.reduce((total, sub) => {
    const monthlyValue = sub.interval === 'yearly' 
      ? sub.amount / 12 
      : sub.amount;
    return total + monthlyValue;
  }, 0);
};

export const calculateChurnRate = (startUsers, endUsers, newUsers) => {
  const churnedUsers = startUsers - (endUsers - newUsers);
  return (churnedUsers / startUsers) * 100;
};

export const calculateLTV = (avgRevenue, churnRate) => {
  return avgRevenue / (churnRate / 100);
};
```

**Business Metrics Framework:**

**SaaS Key Metrics:**
- **Acquisition:** Traffic sources, conversion rates, cost per acquisition (CAC)
- **Activation:** Onboarding completion, time to first value, feature adoption
- **Retention:** Daily/Monthly active users, cohort retention, churn rates
- **Revenue:** Monthly recurring revenue (MRR), average revenue per user (ARPU)
- **Referral:** Net promoter score (NPS), viral coefficient, referral rates

**E-commerce Key Metrics:**
- **Conversion:** Funnel conversion rates, cart abandonment, checkout completion
- **Revenue:** Average order value (AOV), customer lifetime value (CLV)
- **Engagement:** Session duration, pages per session, bounce rate
- **Product:** Product page views, add-to-cart rates, product performance

**Event Taxonomy Standards:**

**Naming Convention:**
- Use snake_case for event names
- Follow object_action pattern (e.g., `user_signup`, `subscription_created`)
- Include relevant context properties
- Maintain consistent property naming

**Standard Properties:**
```javascript
{
  event: 'user_signup',
  properties: {
    user_id: 'uuid',
    email: 'user@example.com',
    source: 'organic',
    campaign: 'summer_2024',
    page: '/signup',
    timestamp: '2024-08-06T10:00:00Z',
    session_id: 'session_uuid'
  }
}
```

**Privacy and Compliance:**

**GDPR Compliance:**
- Implement consent management for tracking
- Provide data anonymization options
- Enable data deletion and export capabilities
- Document data processing and retention policies

**Implementation Patterns:**
```javascript
// lib/privacy.js
export class PrivacyManager {
  constructor() {
    this.hasConsent = this.getStoredConsent();
  }

  requestConsent() {
    // Show consent banner
    return new Promise((resolve) => {
      // Handle user response
    });
  }

  anonymizeData(data) {
    return {
      ...data,
      user_id: this.hashUserId(data.user_id),
      email: undefined,
      ip_address: this.anonymizeIP(data.ip_address)
    };
  }
}
```
