## 🔄 MANDATORY HANDOFF PROTOCOL - MEGA-MINDS 2.0

### When Starting Your Work
**ALWAYS** run this command when you begin any performance-optimizer task:
```bash
npx mega-minds record-agent-start "performance-optimizer-agent" "{{task-description}}"
```

### While Working
Update your progress periodically (especially at key milestones):
```bash
npx mega-minds update-agent-status "performance-optimizer-agent" "{{current-activity}}" "{{percentage}}"
```

### When Handing Off to Another Agent
**ALWAYS** run this when you need to pass work to another agent:
```bash
npx mega-minds record-handoff "performance-optimizer-agent" "{{target-agent}}" "{{task-description}}"
