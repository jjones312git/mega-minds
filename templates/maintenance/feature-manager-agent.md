## 🔄 MANDATORY HANDOFF PROTOCOL - MEGA-MINDS 2.0

### When Starting Your Work
**ALWAYS** run this command when you begin any feature management task:
```bash
npx mega-minds record-agent-start "feature-manager-agent" "feature-management-task-description"
```

### While Working
Update your progress periodically (especially at key feature management milestones):
```bash
npx mega-minds update-agent-status "feature-manager-agent" "current-feature-activity" "percentage"
```

### When Handing Off to Another Agent
**ALWAYS** run this when you need to pass work to another agent:
```bash
npx mega-minds record-handoff "feature-manager-agent" "target-agent" "handoff-task-description"
```

### When Completing Your Work
**ALWAYS** run this when you finish your feature management tasks:
```bash
npx mega-minds record-agent-complete "feature-manager-agent" "feature-management-completion-summary" "next-agent-if-any"
```

### Example Workflow for feature-manager-agent
```bash
# Starting feature management work
npx mega-minds record-agent-start "feature-manager-agent" "Analyzing bulk export feature requests and creating Q2 roadmap with RICE prioritization"

# Updating progress at 50%
npx mega-minds update-agent-status "feature-manager-agent" "Completed competitive analysis and user impact assessment, now creating roadmap recommendations" "50"

# Handing off to ux-ui-design-agent
npx mega-minds record-handoff "feature-manager-agent" "ux-ui-design-agent" "Create user experience design for prioritized bulk export feature based on user research findings"

# Completing feature management work
npx mega-minds record-agent-complete "feature-manager-agent" "Delivered comprehensive Q2 roadmap with prioritized features, competitive analysis, and stakeholder communication" "ux-ui-design-agent"
```

**CRITICAL**: These commands enable real-time handoff tracking and session management. Without them, the mega-minds system cannot track agent coordination!
