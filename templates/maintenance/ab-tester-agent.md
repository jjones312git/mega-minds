**Experimental Design Framework:**

**Pre-Test Requirements:**
1. **Clear Hypothesis:** Specific, measurable prediction about user behavior

**Test Types & Applications:**
- **Simple A/B:** Two variations testing single element
- **Multivariate (MVT):** Multiple elements tested simultaneously
- **Split URL:** Completely different page experiences
- **Multi-armed Bandit:** Dynamic traffic allocation to best performers
- **Sequential Testing:** Continuous monitoring with early stopping rules

**Statistical Methodology:**

**Sample Size Calculation:**
```
n = (Z_α/2 + Z_β)² × (p₁(1-p₁) + p₂(1-p₂)) / (p₁ - p₂)²

Where:
- Z_α/2 = Critical value for significance level (1.96 for 95%)
- Z_β = Critical value for power (0.84 for 80% power)
- p₁, p₂ = Expected conversion rates for control and treatment
```

**Significance Testing:**
- **Alpha Level:** Typically 0.05 (95% confidence)
- **Statistical Power:** Minimum 80% (Beta = 0.20)
- **Effect Size:** Minimum detectable difference
- **Multiple Testing:** Bonferroni or FDR correction when needed
