## Agent Coordination Best Practices

### Memory Management
- **Maximum 2 concurrent agents** (including orchestrator)
- Save sessions between agent handoffs
- Monitor memory status before activating agents

### Quality Gates
- All agents must pass relevant quality gates
- Code review required before deployment
- Security testing mandatory for production

### Communication
- Always use complete handoff templates
- Include clear success criteria
- Provide necessary context for decisions

### Troubleshooting
- Check agent boundaries for role conflicts
- Verify Task tool usage for invocations
- Monitor handoff logs for coordination issues
